                <h3>Recruitment</h3>
                <p>Each Year, We Need To Recruit New Members. Student Branches Are Only As Strong As Their Members. We
                    Try
                    To Attract New Members By Setting Up A Big Media Campaign On Our Social Platforms And Making Booths
                    To
                    Introduce People To The World Of Being An IEEEian. It Is Important To Clearly Outline The
                    Organizationâ€™s
                    Purpose And Succinctly Describe What The Organization Stands For And What It Does. Being Transparent
                    About The Who, The What, And When Helps Attract Potential Members Interested In Working For The
                    Benefit
                    Of The Branch. Providing Examples Of Past Achievements And Strategic Goals Is Also A Great Way To
                    Engage
                    Prospective Recruits. At IEEE BUB, We Serve An Educational And Social Function. We Provide Members
                    With
                    The Opportunity To Build A Sense Of Belonging And Engage With Our Campus.</p>

                <p>
                    Week 4 & 5 Interviews:- In This Phase, We Interview New Members To Identify Their Technical And
                    Non-Technical Knowledge And Determine How And Where They Acquired This Knowledge. We Also
                    Investigate Their Direct And Indirect Knowledge And Their Previous Experiences. We Also Ask
                    Open-Ended Questions, Politely Challenge The Interviewee, And Embrace Pauses And Silence, Giving
                    Interviewees Time To Think. After Examining Their Skills, Scrutinizing Their Behavior And Attitude,
                    And Many Other Aspects That Are Required To Fulfill Our Student Branch Needs, We Go Through The
                    Filtration Process And Send Acceptance Or Rejection Mails To All Candidates..</p>

                <p>
                    Week 6 Welcome Party ( Opening ) :- A Good Orientation Day Helps The New Members Feel Excited About
                    What They Are Going To Do And Achieve. We Organize This Event Every Year To Provide A Social
                    Gathering (Orientation Day) For All The Newcomers To Make Them More Comfortable With The Place And
                    Provide Them With More Information About Us And Our Mission. All Of This Helps Them Adapt Faster And
                    Contribute More. During The Day, The New Board Represents Themselves And Their Plans And Goals, And
                    Gets To Know New Members. We Also Review The Progress Of The Previous Year Through A Video That
                    Represents All Our Achievements And Progress.</p>

                    To Carry Out A Successful Event, We Must Focus On The Planning Stage, This Is The Most Important
                    Stage To Achieve The Proposed Objectives. It Is Necessary To Visualize What We Want To Achieve,
                    Without This We Will Not Be Able To Measure The Results And Verify That The Proposed Objective Was
                    Achieved. In The Planning Process, The Audience To Whom We Are Directing Our Event Is Considered,
                    What Motivates Them And What Does Not, What Their Needs Are And How Our Event Fits In With This. No
                    Matter The Type Of Event We Are Organizing, Or The Way In Which We Reach The Participants, Planning
                    Is The Only Guarantee Of Success.</p>
