When will we realize that now, we are living in the FUTURE? Of course, life will be easier. We will be able to control everything around us standing exactly where we are. This will lead us to our main topic: IOT OR "INTERNET OF THINGS" This is what enables you to make a connection between more than one device in your system, and everything will be under your control.

                    Many of us think programming is difficult and they could not link it to the labor market. Programming is not just a language ... Programming is a way of thinking, So IEEE BUB held CODE OF DUTY III... A Problem Solving contest in its third edition. problem-solving is the process of identifying a problem, developing an algorithm for the identified problem, and finally implementing the algorithm to develop a computer program.

                    After teaching Arduino as an intro to embedded systems in the Track the Sun event, this mega event is moving on to a more advanced take on the Embedded systems field, and it’s the first event teaching the importance of combining software and hardware. Embedded Systems is one of the biggest fields everywhere in the world with the most required jobs these days, we discuss and teach a lot about the field during the event.                 </div>

                    Second installment of the Code of Duty mega event, this event’s main goal was to teach the importance of coding to both, software and hardware engineers and also whoever is interested in the programming field. Two sessions were held about problem solving at BFCAI on 12,13 February 2020. Like the first Code of Duty, a competition was held by the end of the event, but instead of doing it only inside the Banha University, this time Zagazig and Menofia joined...

                    The fourth mega event was about advanced Arduino with basics of embedded systems and robotics, and for first time in Egypt we taught the attendants about solar energy and solar cells to power their robots. The event was a great success and had a huge impact on about 150 students from different ages and fields. Besides learning the basics of Arduino, the attendants also learned about advanced topics such as: Timers, Interrupt and Communication Protocols (like UART).                </div>
